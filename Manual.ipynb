    "# User Manual for Inventory Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Inventory Management System** is an Excel-based tool consisting of three key worksheets. It is designed to help you efficiently manage and track your inventory, calculate stock quantities, credits, and debits. The system automatically updates based on your inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections describe how each worksheet works and how to use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Sheet2: Item List (Core of Stock Management)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sheet2** serves as the foundation of your inventory system. It contains a list of all your items, including unique **Item Codes** and their corresponding **Item Names**. This sheet feeds information into **Sheet1** (where you enter stock transactions) and **Sheet3** (where stock summaries are calculated).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating the Item List\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Item Code**: This is a unique identifier for each product in your inventory. For example:\n",
    "   - `4001` for **Product A**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Item Name**: The name of the product associated with the **Item Code**. For example:\n",
    "   - **Product A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Item Code** | **Item Name**  |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| `4001`        | **Product A**  |\n",
    "| `4002`        | **Product B**  |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linking with Other Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item Codes** and **Item Names** in **Sheet2** are referenced in **Sheet1** and **Sheet3**. This ensures consistent data across all worksheets and eliminates the need for manual entry in those sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Sheet1: Data Entry and Stock Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sheet1** is where you record stock updates, including the addition (credit) or removal (debit) of items from your inventory. You will enter transactions such as item purchases, sales, or stock adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Item Code & Item Name**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item Code**: Use the dropdown menu in the **Item Code** column. The list of available codes comes from **Sheet2**. This allows you to select the correct **Item Code** for your transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item Name**: Once the **Item Code** is selected, the corresponding **Item Name** is automatically populated using a **VLOOKUP** function. You don't need to enter this manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Enter Transaction Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type**: Select whether the transaction is a **Credit** (stock addition) or **Debit** (stock removal).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Quantity**: Enter the quantity of items involved in the transaction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Date**: Input the date of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Automatic Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the **Type** (Credit or Debit) and **Quantity** entered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **Credit** is selected, the quantity is placed in the **Credited** column.\n",
    "- If **Debit** is selected, the quantity is placed in the **Debited** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Using the Update Macro**\n",
    "\n",
    "After entering the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **Update** button to run the macro.\n",
    "2. The system will add a new row with the following details:\n",
    "   - **Date**\n",
    "   - **Item Code**\n",
    "   - **Item Name**\n",
    "   - **Credited** and **Debited** values based on the selected quantity and transaction type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Sheet3: Net Stock Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sheet3** provides a summary of the **Net Stock** for each item. It calculates the total stock for each item by summing up the **Credited** and **Debited** values recorded in **Sheet1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Item Codes and Names**\n",

    "#### 2. **Total Credits and Debits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sheet3** calculates the total **Credited** and **Debited** values for each **Item Code** by summing up the corresponding entries from **Sheet1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Net Quantity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Net Quantity** for each item is calculated as:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Credited** - **Debited**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This gives you the current stock level for each item in your inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Automatic Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sheet3** updates automatically when new data is entered into **Sheet1**. As credits and debits are recorded, the **Net Quantity** will adjust accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Update the System\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Update the Item List (Sheet2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add new items to **Sheet2** by entering the **Item Code** and **Item Name**. This step ensures that you can select these items in **Sheet1** when entering transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Add Stock Updates (Sheet1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to **Sheet1**, select the **Item Code** from the dropdown, and enter the **Quantity**, **Transaction Type** (Credit or Debit), and **Date**.\n",
    "- The system will automatically calculate the **Credited** or **Debited** amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Check the Net Stock (Sheet3)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to **Sheet3** to see the updated **Net Quantity** of each item. The system will automatically adjust the **Net Quantity** based on your inputs in **Sheet1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Item Codes and Names**\n",
    "- Ensure that your **Item List (Sheet2)** is always up-to-date with accurate **Item Codes** and **Item Names**. This guarantees that **Sheet1** and **Sheet3** reflect correct data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Automatic Calculations**\n",
    "- Once you enter the **Type** and **Quantity** in **Sheet1**, the system will automatically calculate the **Credited** and **Debited** amounts for each transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Net Stock Summary**\n",
    "- The **Net Stock** for each item in **Sheet3** is updated automatically. You don't need to manually calculate the quantities in **Sheet3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Macro Usage**\n",
    "- The macro in **Sheet1** runs when you click the **Update** button. Ensure that **macros are enabled** when you open the file for the button to work properly.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Regular Updates**\n",
    "- Keep **Sheet1** updated with correct **Item Codes**, **Quantities**, and **Transaction Types**.\n",
    "- Check **Sheet3** to verify the updated **Net Quantity** of your items.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these instructions, the system will efficiently track and manage your inventory with minimal effort. Simply update **Sheet1** with new stock information, and let the system handle the calculations for you.\n"
